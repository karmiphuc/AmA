Hello, I am Karmi Ph√∫c.

A Full-stack Developer. A Google Enthusiast. A Product Builder. A Life-hacker.

I often write at [karmiphuc.com](http://karmiphuc.com/) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@karmiphuc).

I build things to help people learn and save time like [Visual demo of basic HTML/CSS](http://karmiphuc.com/tools/htmlcss/) and [Facebook Favorite extension for Chrome](http://karmiphuc.com/tools/fbfavorite.html).

You can ask me anything here.

Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.
